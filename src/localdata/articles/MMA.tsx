          <p><b>MMA</b> (Mixed Martial Arts) is a full-contact combat sport that allows the use of both striking and
            grappling arts while both standing and on the ground, including wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, sambo, judo,
            boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, karate, and other styles. The roots of modern mixed martial arts can be
            traced back to the ancient Olympic combat sport of Pankration.</p>
          <p>MMA is often called fighting without rules. Actually, that's not quite correct. Though the rules in MMA
            fights can be fairly tough, we follow certain rules during the MMA competitions in our club. These rules are
            shown below.</p>

          <p>The unified weight division system for women has not been designated yet. In our club, we designate limits
            for seven different weight classes:</p>

          <h5><b>V. Ways to Victory:</b></h5>
          <h6><b>Knockout (KO)</b></h6>
          <p>KO is as soon as a fighter becomes unconscious due to strikes, his opponent is declared the winner. As MMA
            rules allow ground fighting, the fight is stopped to prevent further injury to an unconscious fighter.</p>
          <h6><b>Technical Knockout (TKO)</b></h6>
          <u>Referee Stoppage</u>
          <p>The referee may stop a match in progress if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A fighter becomes dominant to the point where the opponent is unable to intelligently defend himself
              from attacks, which may occur as quickly as a few seconds
            </li>
            <li>A fighter appears to have developed a severe injury: the referee will call for a time out if a fighter's
              ability to continue is in question as a result of apparent injuries, such as a large cut. The ring doctor
              will inspect the fighter and stop the match if the fighter is deemed unable to continue safely, rendering
              the opponent the winner. However, if the match is stopped as a result of an injury from illegal actions by
              the opponent, either a disqualification or no contest will be issued instead.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <u>Corner Stoppage</u>
          <p>A fighter's cornermen may announce defeat on the fighter's behalf by throwing in the towel during the match
            in progress or between rounds.</p>
          <u>Retirement</u>
          <p>If a fighter feels unable to continue after the conclusion of a round, they may inform or have the corner
            inform the referee that they forfeit the match to their opponent.</p>
          <h6><b>Submission</b></h6>
          <p>A fighter may admit defeat during a match by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A tap on the opponent's body</li>
            <li>A tap on the mat or floor</li>
            <li>Verbal announcement</li>
          </ul>
          <h6><b>Technical Submission</b></h6>
          <p>A referee may intervene and call a stop to the contest when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A fighter appears to be unconscious from a grappling hold</li>
            <li>A fighter appears to have suffered a serious injury from a grappling hold</li>
          </ul>
          <h6><b>Decision</b></h6>
          <p>If the match goes the distance, then the outcome of the bout is determined by three judges. The judging
            criteria are organization-specific:</p>
          <u>Unanimous Decision</u>
          <p>All three judges on the panel score a bout unanimously in favor of one fighter.</p>
          <u>Split Decision</u>
          <p>Two judges on the panel score a bout in favor of one fighter, with one judge scoring the bout in favor of
            the other.</p>
          <u>Majority Decision</u>
          <p>Two judges on the panel score a bout in favor of one fighter, with one judge scoring the bout a draw.</p>
          <u>Draw</u>
          <p>All three judges on the panel score a bout unanimously in favor of neither fighter.</p>
          <u>Split Draw</u>
          <p>One judge on the panel scores a bout in favor of one fighter, the second in favor of the other, and the
            third in favor of neither fighter.</p>
          <u>Majority Draw</u>
          <p>Two judges score the bout a draw, with one judge scoring the bout in favor of one fighter.</p>
          <h6><b>Technical Decision</b></h6>
          <p>If a fighter behind or even on points commits an intentional foul during the course of the match, and the
            opponent is unable to continue due to the injury or injuries inflicted by the foul at any subsequent point
            in the fight, the match is stopped and awarded to the injured fighter.</p>
          <h6><b>Technical Draw</b></h6>
          <p>If a fighter ahead on points commits an intentional foul during the course of the match, and the opponent
            is unable to continue due to the injury or injuries inflicted by the foul at any subsequent point in the
            fight, the match is stopped and is awarded a draw.</p>
          <h6><b>Forfeit</b></h6>
          <p>A fighter or their representative may forfeit a match prior to the beginning of the match, thereby losing
            the match.</p>
          <h6><b>Disqualification</b></h6>
          <p>A "warning" will be given when a fighter commits a foul or illegal action or does not follow the referee's
            instruction. Three warnings will result in a disqualification. Moreover, if a fighter is injured and unable
            to continue due to a deliberate illegal technique from their opponent, the opponent will be
            disqualified.</p>
          <h6><b>No Contest</b></h6>
          <p>In the event that both fighters commit a violation of the rules, or a fighter is unable to continue due to
            an injury from an accidental illegal technique, the match will be declared a "No Contest".</p>
          <h5><b>VI. Attire</b></h5>
          <p>It is allowed for fighters to have latitude in their choice of attire, but open finger gloves, a
            mouthguard, and a protective cup are mandatory. It is within a fighter's discretion to tape parts of their
            body, but they cannot wear a gi top, gi pants, wrestling shoes, kneepads, elbow pads, shin guards, or ankle
            supports.</p>
          <h5><b>VII. Rounds</b></h5>
          <p>Uses three 5-minute rounds. There is a two-minute rest period between each round.</p>
