          <p><b>Submission grappling</b> (Submission wrestling) is a non-striking hybrid style formed from wrestling,
            jiu jitsu, sambo, and many other submission fighting styles. It consists of applying submission holds and
            choking techniques to make the opponent abandon the fight. Submission grappling plays an important role in
            the practice of <b>Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</b> and is considered an effective form of <b>self-defense</b>.
