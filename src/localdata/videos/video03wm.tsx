            <h4>Beach Wrestling. Mixed Tournament. Two girls vs one man. September, 2010</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Alex</b> came to St. Petersburg at the weekend and offered Tais (5'7" / 132 lb) and <b>Natalia
                Mysik</b> (5'11" / 154 lb) to hold a mixed tournament on beach wrestling. He had been practicing
                wrestling a lot recently, and had become physically stronger - 5'9" / 150 lb, which allowed him to count
                on a successful performance.
            </p>
            <p>The mixed beach tournament went in three rounds. The fights between the girls were hard enough,
                especially in the first two rounds. The mixed contests started with Alexâ€™s convincing win over Natalia .
                Then the luck turned away from Alex ...</p>
            <p>If you like <b>mixed competitive wrestling</b>, then we believe you will love our film. Watch how
                everything was!</p>
