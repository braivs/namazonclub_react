            <h3>VIDEO {videoNumber}</h3>
            <h4>MMA. Darya Balina vs Olga. July, 2012</h4>
            <p>This is the second MMA fight at the <b>"First Nevsky Arena Tournament"</b>. <b>Darya Balina</b> (5'4" /
                124 lb) and <b>Olga</b> (5'7" / 139 lb) are young participants, who don't have yet enough experience in
                MMA fights, but that doesn't make their fight less interesting or entertaining; their punches are still
                strong, the struggle is tough.
            </p>
            <img className={sC.videosMainImg} src={imgMain} alt="imgMain"/>
            <p>The girls are fighting three full rounds, and no one of them wants to give up.</p>
            <p>
                If you don't like fights with a great amount of punches and kicks then you might perhaps be a little bit
                disappointed when watching this fight. However, if you love real, hard, uncompromising fights then
                youâ€™ll definitely like their match.
