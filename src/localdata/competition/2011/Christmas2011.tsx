      <h4>Submission Grappling Tournament "Christmas Cup 2011"</h4>

      <p>
        The Submission Grappling tournament <b>"Christmas Cup 2011"</b>, organized by the Namazon Club and Kempo-Kan School
        of Martial Arts, took place on January 6, 2011, in a school sports hall. The tournament featured two rounds and
        included the following participants: <b>Natalia Mysik</b> (5'11" / 154 lb), <b>Ksenia Voloshina</b> (5'3" / 141 lb),
        and <b>Valentina Perfilyeva</b> (5'8" / 139 lb).<br/>
        One notable feature of the competition was the significant disparity in weight and height among the wrestlers. Natalia,
        being much heavier and taller than her opponents, frequently utilized her size advantage to secure pinning holds,
        especially School Girl Pins, which she would then convert into armlocks or chokes. One of these chokes even resulted
        in her opponent being knocked out.
