        The female power combat tournament was organized in cooperation with the Female Single Combat Club "Namazon" and
        the St. Petersburg Athletic Center. The full title of the competition was <b>"The Female Single Combat
        Tournament for the prizes of the SBR Athletic Center and the Namazon Club"</b>. The aim of the competition was
        to popularize non-traditional power single combats between women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, the tournament was structured as a crossfit competition consisting of the following events:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tug-of-war (a win is awarded with 2 points);</li>
        <li>Arm wrestling on the floor - with both left and right arms (a win with either arm is awarded with 1
          point);
        </li>
        <li>Leg wrestling - wrestling with legs in sitting position (a win in each of the 2 positions is awarded with 1
          point);
        </li>
        <li>"Sumo-wrestling" with simplified rules (a win is awarded with 2 points).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The competition format was based on the expected participants. Until the last day, it was uncertain which girls
        would compete. Eventually, on October 2, 2013, pairs of girls were formed to compete in 3 qualification rounds
        to determine a winner in the amateur division:

        i) To minimize the technical advantage of more experienced opponents in table arm wrestling, matches were
        conducted on the floor, where physical strength typically outweighs technical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        ii) The goal in leg wrestling is to use thigh strength to close the opponent's knees together, while the
        opponent tries to open them; positions are then exchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        iii) Also known as "Mercy" wrestling, the objective is to push the opponent outside the mat boundaries or make
        them touch the ground with any part of their body (touching the ground with one knee is allowed).
