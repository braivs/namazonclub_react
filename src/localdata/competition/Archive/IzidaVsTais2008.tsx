      <h4>Izida vs Tais 2008</h4>
      <p>
        The fight between Tais and the well-known Ukrainian bodybuilder Izida can be called one of the most interesting
        sporting events of 2008. At that time, <b>Izida</b> (5’6” / 155 lb) was relatively new to wrestling, but she
        was a powerful competitor and demonstrated excellent form. <b>Tais</b> (5’7” / 132 lb), while also physically
        strong, was expectedly inferior to her muscular opponent in raw physical power. However, Tais was more skilled
        than Izida as a wrestler.<br/>
        We anticipated an intriguing match because it’s always fascinating to witness a contest between SKILL and pure
        physical POWER. You can observe how one prevailed over the other in this struggle by watching the video clip.

        Unfortunately, <b>Izida</b> had only one fight with <b>Tais</b>.<br/>
        Since then, Izida has continued wrestling (mostly in mixed competitions) and has performed in the <b>Professional
        Wrestling Federation (PWF)</b>.<br/>
        One might expect that, with more experience under her belt, Izida would demonstrate her character by seeking to
        amend her defeat and challenge Tais to a rematch. However, this has yet to happen.
