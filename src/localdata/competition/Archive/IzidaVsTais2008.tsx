      <h4>Izida vs Tais 2008</h4>
      <p>
        The fight between Tais and a well-known Ukrainian bodybuilder Izida can be called one of the most interesting
        sporting events in 2008. At this time <b>Izida</b> (5’6” / 155 lb) was nearly a beginner in wrestling, but she
        was a powerful lady and demonstrated excellent competition form. <b>Tais</b> (5’7” / 132 lb) was (and is) also
        physically strong, but as it had been expected, appeared to be inferior to her muscular opponent in physical
        power. At the same time, however, she was more skilled than Izida as a wrestler.<br/>
        We looked forward to an interesting match, because it’s always interesting to see a battle between SKILL and
        pure physical POWER.
        You can see how one prevailed over the other in this struggle if you watch the video clip.

        Unfortunately, <b>Izida</b> had only one fight with <b>Tais</b>.<br/>
        From that time on, Izida continued with wrestling (mixed for the most part) and performed in the <b>Professional
        Wrestling Federation (PWF)</b>.<br/>
        You probably would think that, having gained more experience as a wrestler, Izida would show character and a
        desire to make amend for her defeat and would challenge Tais to a rematch. However, it’s still not happening.
