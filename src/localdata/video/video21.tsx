      <h4>MMA. Darya Balina vs Olga. July, 2012</h4>
      <p>This is the second MMA fight at the <b>"First Nevsky Arena Tournament"</b>. <b>Darya Balina</b> (5'4" /
        124 lb) and <b>Olga</b> (5'7" / 139 lb) are young participants, who don't have yet enough experience in
        MMA fights, but that doesn't make their fight less interesting or entertaining; their punches are still
        strong, the struggle is tough.
      </p>

      <p>The girls are fighting three full rounds, and no one of them wants to give up.</p>
      <p>
        If you don't like fights with a great amount of punches and kicks then you might perhaps be a little bit
        disappointed when watching this fight. However, if you love real, hard, uncompromising fights then
        youâ€™ll definitely like their match.
