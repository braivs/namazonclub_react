                This is the continuation of the movie 1. It features all the matches of the second round.<br/>
                Here you can see another aggressive fight between the two favorites: <b>Tais</b> (5'7" / 128 lb) and <b>Maria
                Rylyova</b> (5'7" / 126 lb). And especially dramatic were the fights of <b>Nadezhda Akhmerova</b> (5'6"
                / 128 lb). Thus, in the struggle with Tais, Nadezhda was knocked downâ€¦ however, she managed to continue
                the match.<br/>
                In the fight with Maria, Nadezhda gave her a hell of a struggle. The advantage shifted back and forth
                between the two girls.
