      <h3>VIDEO {videoNumber}</h3>
      <h4>Mixed wrestling. Villian vs Tais. Part 1. 2014</h4>
      <p>
        In comparison with Alexandr, whom you can see in our <NavLink to="/universe/video/38">VIDEO
        38</NavLink>, <b>Villian</b> doesnâ€™t appear as big and strong, weighing only 180 pounds. However, he compensates
        with speed, experience, and wrestling skill. In their personal matches, Villian usually emerges as the victor.
        Interestingly, despite being 44 pounds lighter than Villian, <b>Tais</b> finds it easier to fight Villian than
        Alexandr because she can more effectively apply her techniques against him.
