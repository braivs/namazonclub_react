        Our fighting club is attended by both girls and young men. For the girls itâ€™s more comfortable to practice many
        of wrestling techniques on male partners (we are grateful to the men for their assistance!).
        Sporting mixed wrestling is also practiced with us. In this case, the competitors for the fights are selected
        based on their weight categories and physical strength.
